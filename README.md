***Periodic Table Project***
This is the fourth project of the relational database course on freeCodeCamp toward receiving a relational database certification. 
The project provides an elements and properties table that needed to be cleaned and formatted where PostgreSQL commands are passed to the bash terminal and logged in the bashtermianl.sh script for continuity.

After editting the pre-existing tables, I use the properties table to create a types table as a key for the unique element types. 

I created a git repository through the bash terminal called periodic_table. After creating the repository, I create a shell script titled element.sh to accept a value (atomic_number, symbol, name) to pull information from the properties table and output a message detailing the features of the element.
